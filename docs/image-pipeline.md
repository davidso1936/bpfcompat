# Image and Profile Pipeline

This document describes where every kernel/distro image used by `bpfcompat`
comes from, how it is cached and integrity-checked, and how to add a new
profile. The goal is that anyone can reproduce a compatibility matrix from
scratch — or verify exactly which image bytes produced a past result.

## Design position

`bpfcompat` does **not** build custom OS images. Profiles reference
unmodified upstream vendor cloud images (Ubuntu cloud images, Debian cloud
images, AlmaLinux/Rocky GenericCloud, Amazon Linux KVM images, Oracle UEK
images, openSUSE Leap, and so on). This is deliberate:

- Distro kernels carry vendor patches and backports that diverge from
  upstream — testing the vendor's own published image tests the kernel your
  users actually run, which custom-built images cannot do.
- Every image is independently obtainable from the vendor: there is no
  private build step between "what the vendor ships" and "what was tested".

The trade-off is that vendor `current/` URLs mutate over time. The
mechanisms below exist to make that explicit and controllable.

## Profile anatomy

Each target is one YAML file under `vm/profiles/`:

```yaml
id: ubuntu-22.04-5.15
distro: ubuntu
version: "22.04"
kernel_family: "5.15"
arch: x86_64
image:
  source_url: "https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/jammy/current/jammy-server-cloudimg-amd64.img"
  local_path: "vm/cache/ubuntu-22.04.qcow2"
  # Optional: pin the exact image. Requires a release-versioned source_url;
  # "current" URLs mutate and will eventually fail the pin (by design).
  # sha256: "<digest>"
boot:
  memory_mb: 1024
  cpus: 1
```

Matrices (`matrices/*.yaml`) select sets of profile ids; the tiering
rationale is in [`profile-catalog.md`](profile-catalog.md).

## Integrity: recorded always, pinned optionally

- **Recording (always):** the first time an image is used, its sha256 is
  computed and cached in a `<image>.sha256` sidecar next to the file in
  `vm/cache/`. Every VM target's report notes include
  `base image sha256: …`, so any past matrix result is attributable to
  exact image bytes even when the vendor URL has since changed.
- **Pinning (opt-in):** setting `image.sha256` in a profile makes a
  mismatching download or cached file fail the run instead of silently
  testing different bytes. Use pinning with release-versioned URLs
  (for example `releases/22.04/release-20260601/...` instead of
  `current/`).

## Acquisition and caching

Images download on first use into `vm/cache/` (never committed). Bulk
prefetch targets:

```bash
make vm-images                    # MVP matrix images
make vm-images-extended           # extended catalog
make vm-images-tier1              # enterprise/cloud tier
make vm-images-expanded-2026      # full expanded campaign
make vm-images-expanded-2026-dry-run
```

Manual/licensed images (SLES, Bottlerocket, Talos, mainline archives) have
no public URL; import them explicitly:

```bash
make import-required-images SLES156_IMG=/abs/path/sles15.6.qcow2
make manual-image-check
```

## Audit and readiness

- `make profile-catalog-audit` — validates every profile's source URL is
  still reachable and records audit evidence.
- `make matrix-readiness` — reports which matrix profiles are runnable
  right now (image cached + executor transport supported).
- `.github/workflows/profile-catalog-maintenance.yml` — runs the audit on a
  schedule so dead vendor URLs surface as CI signal, not as a failed run.
- `go test ./internal/vm -run TestAllProfileYAMLLoadAndValidate` —
  validates profile YAML integrity.

## Kernel freshness vs kernel-crawler

A cached image keeps producing matrix evidence for the kernel it shipped
with, even after the distro has moved on. The freshness oracle makes that
drift visible by comparing each profile's last-validated kernel release
against the per-distro kernel inventory that
[falcosecurity/kernel-crawler](https://github.com/falcosecurity/kernel-crawler)
publishes weekly ([per-arch `list.json`](https://falcosecurity.github.io/kernel-crawler/)):

```bash
./bin/bpfcompat kernel-freshness                 # download inventory, print table
./bin/bpfcompat kernel-freshness --fail-on-stale # exit 2 when evidence is behind
```

- `vm/kernel-baselines.yaml` (committed) records the last-validated kernel
  per profile plus its crawler mapping: distro key, target flavor
  (`ubuntu-generic` vs `ubuntu-kvm`), a `release_prefix` pinning the series,
  and an optional `release_contains` for distros that mix major releases
  under one key (`el9` vs `el10`).
- After a matrix run, refresh the baselines from the report:
  `bpfcompat kernel-freshness --update-from-report reports/<run>.json`.
  Profiles the file doesn't know yet are appended without a mapping and
  show up as `uncovered` until one is added.
- `.github/workflows/kernel-freshness.yml` runs the comparison weekly
  (after kernel-crawler's own Monday refresh) as a non-blocking signal
  lane: a red run means "refresh the image, re-run the matrix, update the
  baselines", never a blocked merge.
- Statuses are honest about coverage limits: `uncovered` (kernel-crawler
  publishes no Debian entries, for example), `no-entries` (EOL series the
  archive dropped), and `no-kernel` (profile never validated) are reported
  distinctly from `stale`.

The crawler indexes header packages, not bootable images, so it serves as
a freshness oracle only — the boot substrate stays unmodified vendor cloud
images.

## Generated lanes (no prebuilt image at all)

Two lanes construct their environment at run time instead of downloading a
distro image:

- **virtme-ng upstream lane**: `make upstream-kernel-runnable` queries
  kernel.org for current mainline/RC/LTS releases and *generates* profiles
  (`matrices/upstream-kernel-runnable.yaml`); virtme-ng builds/boots the
  kernel directly. Reproducibility comes from the recorded kernel release
  context, not an image digest.
- **Firecracker lane**: `make firecracker-runnable` generates profiles
  around a host-local uncompressed kernel plus a busybox initramfs that
  bpfcompat assembles on the fly (see
  [`firecracker-backend.md`](firecracker-backend.md)). The validator and
  artifact are injected into the generated initramfs; nothing opaque is
  downloaded.

## Adding a profile (checklist)

1. Find the vendor's cloud image URL — prefer a release-versioned URL over
   `current/`.
2. Create `vm/profiles/<id>.yaml` with `id`, `distro`, `version`,
   `kernel_family`, `arch`, `image.source_url`, `image.local_path`
   (under `vm/cache/`), and boot resources. Add `image.sha256` if the URL
   is release-versioned.
3. Run `go test ./internal/vm -run TestAllProfileYAMLLoadAndValidate`.
4. Add the profile id to the appropriate matrix in `matrices/` and tier in
   [`profile-catalog.md`](profile-catalog.md).
5. Run `make profile-catalog-audit` and a single-profile smoke:
   `./bin/bpfcompat test --artifact examples/simple-pass/simple_pass.bpf.o
   --matrix <your-matrix> ...`.

Cloud-init differences are handled by profile fields (SSH user candidates,
NoCloud seed delivery mode); see existing RHEL/Amazon Linux profiles for
non-default examples.

## Known gaps (roadmap)

- No multi-version pinned catalog yet: profiles track one URL each, so
  pinning everything to release-versioned URLs needs a refresh routine
  (candidate: extend `profile-catalog-maintenance.yml` to propose pin
  bumps as PRs).
- The freshness oracle flags profiles whose evidence is behind, but
  refreshing is still manual (re-download image, re-run matrix,
  `--update-from-report`). A follow-up could automate that as a proposed
  PR.
- Some cataloged profiles (Talos, Bottlerocket, Flatcar, Amazon Linux 2
  with 4.14) are not runnable on the current SSH/cloud-init executor and
  are marked non-blocking in matrices.
- ARM64 image entries exist but need a native ARM64 KVM runner.
