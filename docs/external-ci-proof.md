# External CI Proof (B-04)

As of: 2026-06-03
Blocker: `B-04` (External CI Proof)

## Objective

Prove the composite GitHub Action works in a clean third-party repository and
that compatibility failures block CI with `rc=2`.

## Conclusion

External third-party single-artifact CI integration is demonstrated with both:

1. pass path (`rc=0`) and successful workflow conclusion, and
2. required-failure path (`rc=2`) that fails the workflow as a gate.

Suite-mode external CI integration is also demonstrated in the clean reference
repository with two artifacts running through one suite file on a self-hosted
Linux/KVM runner.

## Current Action Shape

The action now supports two integration modes:

1. single-artifact mode with `artifact`, `manifest`, `matrix`, `out`, and
   `markdown` inputs, and
2. suite mode with a `suite` YAML file that lists multiple artifact/manifest
   cases.

Suite mode is intended for projects with several `.bpf.o` outputs, matching the
common maintainer request for a CI input that accepts a VM/kernel list, a list
of artifacts, and manifest-described test steps.
